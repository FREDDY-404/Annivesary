        As I look back on our journey together, Iâ€™m overwhelmed by the beautiful moments that have brought us closer, and I just want you to know how much I cherish you.
        I still remember our first date on 2.11.2024. A day that felt like magicðŸ’–. Being with you, talking, laughing, and sharing that special connection, was truly one of the happiest moments of my life. It was the start of something so precious, and it made me realize how lucky I am to have youâœ¨.

          9.11.2024, you werenâ€™t feeling well because of your period. I remember how much pain you were in, and it hurt me to see you like that. I was so worried about you, 
          and all I wanted was to take care of you and make sure you felt better.
